/**
 * Created by matao on 10/15/16.
 *
 * <p>
 * Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with'%20'.
 * You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string
 * to hold the additional characters,
 * and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
 * (Note: if imple- menting in Java,
 * please use a character array so that you can perform this opera- tion in place.)
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: "Mr John Smith Output: "Mr%20Dohn%20Smith"
 *
 * 将字符串中的空格全部替换为"%20"，假定该字符串尾部有足够的空间存放新增字符，并且知道字符串的"真实"长度。
 * Java请用字符数字实现。
